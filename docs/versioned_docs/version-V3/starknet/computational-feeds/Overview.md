Empiric is an oracle fully on-chain. All the data that you consume through Empiric smart-contracts was aggregated from data that was pushed on-chain by reputable exchanges and market makers. This makes Empiric oracle transparent, and auditable, but also programmable. You can compose and program data with Cairo, in order to get the right computed data for your protocol.
