            You told your friends you werenâ€™t bringing your phone, to try and
            experience what travel was like back in the day. You bought a map, a
            bottle of water and a camera just for this trip. But the map was
            from 2005, the landscape had changed and no one had verified the
            map. So here you are, in the middle of a large field, which the map
            continues to claim is a local grocer.
